### The 2048 game.

This is my first cocos2d project, which adds to my experience and makes me more familiar with the useing of cocos2d

This game is known by nearly every one so I'm not going to introduce it's playing rules.

Here are the screenshots. The firsts one shows operating by mouse, the second one shows operating by arrow keys which are <kbd>Up</kbd> <kbd>Down</kbd> <kbd>Left</kbd> <kbd>Right</kbd>
